rediscache is a function decorator that will cache its result in a Redis database.

Parameters:
- refresh: the number of seconds after which the cached data will be refreshed using the decorated function.
- expire: the number of seconds after which the cached data will altogether disapear from the Redis database.
- default: the value that will be returned if the data is not found in the cache. It cannot be None.
It can be bytes, string, int or float.
- enabled: This is True by default but enables to programmatically disable the cach if required.

It also reads form the environment:
- REDIS_SERVICE_HOST: the redis server host name or IP. Default is 'localhost'.
- REDIS_SERVICE_PORT: the port that the redis server listen to. Default is 6379.

Note:
A key associated to the decorated function is created using the function name and its parameters. This is based
on the value returned by the repr() function (ie: the __repr__() member) of each paramter. user defined objects
will have this function return by default a string like this:
"<amadeusbook.services.EmployeesService object at 0x7f41dedd7128>"
This will not do as each instance of the object will have a different representation no matter what. The direct
consequence will be that each key in the cache will be different, so values in cache will never be reused.
So you need to make sure that your parameters return a meaningful representation value.

- Check what happens if redis database is getting full

        - Raw storage of byte string that you do not want to be decoded: use the decode=False.
        - JSON dumps data that doesn't need to be loaded before it is sent by a REST API: use serializer=dumps but no deserializer.
